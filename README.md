# Langchain Prompts Repository

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a collection of Langchain prompts, examples, and templates designed to help developers build and experiment with language models using Langchain framework.

Over the past year, I have researched and developed numerous prompt engineering techniques and workflows to optimize language model interactions. This repo captures that journey and showcases practical prompt examples for various use cases.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **Prompt_Templates/** – Predefined prompt templates for common tasks.
- **Examples/** – Sample scripts demonstrating Langchain usage.
- **Chatbots/** – Conversational AI prompt implementations.
- **Utilities/** – Helper functions and tools for prompt management.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Modular prompt templates  
✔ Sample applications for chatbots and assistants  
✔ Utilities to streamline prompt creation  
✔ Experimentation and testing scripts
